    * You can open the console by pressing **`(Tilda key)**  on your keyboard. When the console is opened you can type **_help_** to list all the commands.
3) Why does Envy Client crash when I start it?
    * Make sure you are on the [latest](https://download.envyclient.com/) version of Envy Client. If it still crashes delete the **Envy** folder in **.minecraft**. This should fix the issue. If the issue still occurs make a new issue and post your latest crash log.
